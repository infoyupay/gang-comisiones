/**
 * Contains the use case components for editing existing concepts.<br/>
 * Controllers in this package are responsible for loading the target entity, validating updates, performing permission
 * checks, delegating the update to the application services, and notifying the UI with the outcome.<br/>
 * Typical flow:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Receive the concept to edit and confirm it is eligible for modification.</li>
 *   <li>Validate the new values and ensure required privileges are in place.</li>
 *   <li>Invoke the service layer to apply changes asynchronously.</li>
 *   <li>Update the UI with the modified entity or display a contextual error message.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * <strong>Consistency:</strong><br/>
 * The update pipeline embraces a fail-fast approach for invalid inputs and permission issues, helping keep both the
 * domain model and UI state consistent.
 * <br/>
 * <strong>Resilience:</strong><br/>
 * Errors are logged and surfaced to users in a friendly manner. The view is kept in a coherent state regardless of
 * the outcome of the operation.
