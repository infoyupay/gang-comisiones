/**
 * Contains the use case components for creating concepts.<br/>
 * Controllers in this package validate input, apply permission checks, delegate the creation to the corresponding
 * application services, and notify the UI upon completion.<br/>
 * Typical flow:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Collect user input and validate mandatory fields and formats.</li>
 *   <li>Verify the active user and confirm required privileges are present.</li>
 *   <li>Invoke the service layer to persist the new concept asynchronously.</li>
 *   <li>Report success with the created entity or display a meaningful error message.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * <strong>Asynchrony:</strong><br/>
 * Operations return asynchronously. UI updates occur on completion to keep the interface responsive and to clearly
 * reflect success, failure, or validation issues.
 * <br/>
 * <strong>Error handling:</strong><br/>
 * Failures are logged and shown to the user without exposing internal details. Validation errors are presented
 * with clear, actionable guidance.
