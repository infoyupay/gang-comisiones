/**
 * Provides the concept use case layer, organizing application flows related to concept lifecycle management.<br/>
 * The package defines interaction contracts between UI views and application services to create, edit, and manage
 * concepts while enforcing security and consistency rules.<br/>
 * Responsibilities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Coordinating user-driven actions with domain services.</li>
 *   <li>Propagating privileges to views so available actions reflect the current user capabilities.</li>
 *   <li>Handling asynchronous operations and surfacing results, errors, and empty states to the UI.</li>
 *   <li>Promoting a clear separation of concerns between orchestration, domain logic, and presentation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br/>
 * <strong>Design notes:</strong><br/>
 * Use case controllers are thin orchestrators. They validate session state and permissions, then delegate work to
 * services and update the view with the outcome. Error conditions are logged and presented to the user with actionable
 * feedback when possible.
